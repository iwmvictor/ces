## AI-Assisted Routing

A simple but functional model was built to route complaints based on category and keywords. Though not deeply complex due to time limits, it shows promising scalability with future ML integration.

## Challenges Faced

- Limited time to balance backend, frontend, and model integration.
- Learning curve around designing an effective routing model.
- Managing state and role-based views securely and intuitively.
- Light/Dark mode support deferred due to focus on core functionality.

## Future Improvements

- Native Mobile App (iOS + Android)
- Chatbot Assistant for instant citizen support
- Community/Forum integration for public discussions
- Advanced analytics dashboard for agencies
- Full audit trail and complaint history
